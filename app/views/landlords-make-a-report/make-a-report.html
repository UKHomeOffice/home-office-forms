      <p>Use this service to tell us about someone who no longer has the right to rent.</p>
      <p>The person you are telling us about must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>already be renting your property as their main home</li>
        <li>have moved into your property after 01/12/2014</li>
        <li>be at least 18 years old </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Before you start
      </h2>

      <p>
       You must have already checked the occupier's right to rent when their tenancy started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before making a report you must be confident that an existing occupier on whom you carried out initial checks at the start of their tenancy no longer has the right to rent by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-document-checks-a-user-guide">checking their relevant documents</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If the documents are being held by the Home Office or the person has an outstanding application or appeal, you must <a href="https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml">get verification from the Home Office</a> first regarding the person's ongoing right to rent.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have not carried out further document checks on someone who is renting your property, but you suspect a person is in the UK illegally, you can report them in confidence by using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-immigration-crime">crime reporting service</a>.
